### ACUW Halloween Party: RSVP NOW!

Want to share your favorite anime/manga with others? Want to cosplay or wear a cool outfit for Halloween but don't have friends who appreciate it? Want to make new friends who are into anime and manga? Then come to the ACUW Halloween Party!

We are hosting an anime-themed night party where cosplayers and attendees with Halloween outfits can win special prizes and gifts. We'll also have Halloween candy for everyone to give to their favorite cosplayers! In addition, we've prepared board games, snacks, and boba. You can also enjoy a fun mask-making activity.
