Hi everyone! We are excited to announce our Chinese New Year special event, which will take place on January 25, from 7:30 PM to 10:00 PM at Madrona Hall, Room 313, on the north side of campus.

ACUW has prepared a variety of Chinese New Year snacks, a free lottery, and more! We'll also have great performances by many cosplayers and the Kirameki Palettes dance group. Don't forget to participate in our New Year fortune-telling game to see what good luck awaits you in 2025! Of course, the event will also have red envelope surprises and a festive atmosphere. Come and celebrate a happy Chinese New Year with fellow ACGN enthusiasts!

If you have any questions, feel free to ask the club administrators!
